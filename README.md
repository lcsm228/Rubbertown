## What is Rubbertown?
Rubbertown is a hub of industrial manufacturing plants within the city of Louisville that was established in 1918. Surrounded by residential homes, it lies right in the center of one of Louisville’s most poverty-ridden neighborhoods. It is home to over 10 industrial air pollutants, including Hydrofluorocarbon-23, a super pollutant more damaging to the climate than all the cars in Louisville.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to draw attention to the environmental injustices posed on a vulnerable community by an industrial district that contributes to and exacerbates the problems of air pollution and climate crisis. I want to provide a visualization that properly shows the close proximity of residents to a source that has the potential to cut the life expectancy of those in the community by as much as 13 years compared to the other parts of Louisville.

## Things to Note
Notice how Rubbertown is located in the Ohio River Valley. Residents not only have to worry about air pollution from the industrial plants, but flooding in the area as well. Flooding of the Ohio River Valley is a threat to residents' health because chemical pollutants from the industrial plants can enter into the water and soil as well. All of these pollutants have adverse effects on human health which cuts the lifespan of anyone near.
