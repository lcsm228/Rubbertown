# Rubbertown
#### A Virtual Tour of Louisville’s Most Prominent Industrial District

38.2134° N, 85.8380° W

Rubbertown is a hub of industrial manufacturing plants within the city of Louisville that was established in 1918. Surrounded by residential homes, it lies right in the center of one of Louisville’s most poverty-ridden neighborhoods. It is home to over 10 industrial air pollutants, including Hydrofluorocarbon-23, a super pollutant more damaging to the climate than all the cars in Louisville.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to draw attention to the environmental injustices posed on a vulnerable community by an industrial district that contributes to and exacerbates the problems of air pollution and climate crisis. I want to provide a visualization that properly shows the close proximity of residents to a source that has the potential to cut the life expectancy of those in the community by as much as 13 years compared to the other parts of Louisville.
